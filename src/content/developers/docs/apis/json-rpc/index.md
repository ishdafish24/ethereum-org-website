description: A stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol for Ethereum clients.
lang: en

---

In order for a software application to interact with the Ethereum blockchain (by reading blockchain data and/or sending transactions to the network), it must connect to an Ethereum node.

For this purpose, every [Ethereum client](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients) implements a [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), so there are a uniform set of methods that applications can rely on.

JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. It defines several data structures and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over HTTP, or in many various message passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.

## Client implementations {#client-implementations}

Ethereum clients each may utilize different programming languages when implementing the JSON-RPC specification. See individual [client documentation](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients) for further details related to specific programming languages. We recommend checking the documentation of each client for the latest API support information.

## Convenience Libraries {#convenience-libraries}

While you may choose to interact directly with Ethereum clients via the JSON-RPC API, there are often easier options for dapp developers. Many [JavaScript](/developers/docs/apis/javascript/#available-libraries) and [backend API](/developers/docs/apis/backend/#available-libraries) libraries exist to provide wrappers on top of the JSON-RPC API. With these libraries, developers can write intuitive, one-line methods in the programming language of their choice to initialize JSON-RPC requests (under the hood) that interact with Ethereum.

## Spec {#spec}

[Read the full JSON-RPC API spec on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis).

## Conventions {#conventions}

### Hex value encoding {#hex-encoding}

Two key data types get passed over JSON: unformatted byte arrays and quantities. Both are passed with a hex encoding but with different requirements for formatting.

#### Quantities {#quantities-encoding}

When encoding quantities (integers, numbers): encode as hex, prefix with "0x", the most compact representation (slight exception: zero should be represented as "0x0").

Here are some examples:

- 0x41 (65 in decimal)
- 0x400 (1024 in decimal)
- WRONG: 0x (should always have at least one digit - zero is "0x0")
- WRONG: 0x0400 (no leading zeroes allowed)
- WRONG: ff (must be prefixed 0x)

### Unformatted data {#unformatted-data-encoding}

When encoding unformatted data (byte arrays, account addresses, hashes, bytecode arrays): encode as hex, prefix with "0x", two hex digits per byte.

Here are some examples:

- 0x41 (size 1, "A")
- 0x004200 (size 3, "\0B\0")
- 0x (size 0, "")
- WRONG: 0xf0f0f (must be even number of digits)
- WRONG: 004200 (must be prefixed 0x)

### The default block parameter {#default-block}

The following methods have an extra default block parameter:

- [eth_getBalance](#eth_getbalance)
- [eth_getCode](#eth_getcode)
- [eth_getTransactionCount](#eth_gettransactioncount)
- [eth_getStorageAt](#eth_getstorageat)
- [eth_call](#eth_call)

When requests are made that act on the state of Ethereum, the last default block parameter determines the height of the block.

The following options are possible for the defaultBlock parameter:

- `HEX String` - an integer block number
- `String "earliest"` for the earliest/genesis block
- `String "latest"` - for the latest mined block
- `String "pending"` - for the pending state/transactions

## Usage Example {#usage-example}

### Deploying a contract using JSON_RPC {#deploying-contract}

This section includes a demonstration of how to deploy a contract using only the RPC interface. There are alternative routes to deploying contracts where this complexity is abstracted awayâ€”for example, using libraries built on top of the RPC interface such as [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) and [web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py). These abstractions are generally easier to understand and less error-prone, but it is still helpful to understand what is happening under the hood.

The following is a straightforward smart contract called `Multiply7` that will be deployed using the JSON-RPC interface to an Ethereum node. This tutorial assumes the reader is already running a Geth node. More information on nodes and clients is available [here](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/run-a-node). Please refer to individual [client](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) documentation to see how to start the HTTP JSON-RPC for non-Geth clients. Most clients default to serving on `localhost:8545`.

```javascript
contract Multiply7 {
    event Print(uint);
    function multiply(uint input) returns (uint) {
        Print(input * 7);
        return input * 7;
    }
}
```

The first thing to do is make sure the HTTP RPC interface is enabled. This means we supply Geth with the `--http` flag on startup. In this example we use the Geth node on a private development chain. Using this approach we don't need ether on the real network.

```bash

geth --http --dev --mine --miner.threads 1 --unlock 0 console 2>>geth.log

```

This will start the HTTP RPC interface on `http://localhost:8545`.

We can verify that the interface is running by retrieving the Coinbase address and balance using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). Please note that data in these examples will differ on your local node. If you want to try these commands, replace the request params in the second curl request with the result returned from the first.

```bash
curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_coinbase", "id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":["0x9b1d35635cc34752ca54713bb99d38614f63c955"]}

curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance", "params": ["0x9b1d35635cc34752ca54713bb99d38614f63c955", "latest"], "id":2}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545
{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x1639e49bba16280000"}
```

Because numbers are hex encoded, the balance is returned in wei as a hex string. If we want to have the balance in ether as a number we can use web3 from the Geth console.

```javascript
web3.fromWei("0x1639e49bba16280000", "ether")
// "410"
```

Now that there is some ether on our private development chain, we can deploy the contract. The first step is to compile the Multiply7 contract to byte code that can be sent to the EVM. To install solc, the Solidity compiler, follow the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html). (You might want to use an older `solc` release to match [the version of compiler used for our example](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.20).)

The next step is to compile the Multiply7 contract to byte code that can be send to the EVM.

```bash
echo 'pragma solidity ^0.4.16; contract Multiply7 { event Print(uint); function multiply(uint input) public returns (uint) { Print(input * 7); return input * 7; } }' | solc --bin

```

Now that we have the compiled code we need to determine how much gas it costs to deploy it. The RPC interface has an `eth_estimateGas` method that will give us an estimate.

```bash
curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method": "eth_estimateGas", "params": [{"from": "0x9b1d35635cc34752ca54713bb99d38614f63c955", "data": "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"}], "id": 5}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"result":"0x1c31e"}
```

And finally deploy the contract.

```bash
curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method": "eth_sendTransaction", "params": [{"from": "0x9b1d35635cc34752ca54713bb99d38614f63c955", "gas": "0x1c31e", "data": "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"}], "id": 6}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545

```

The transaction is accepted by the node and a transaction hash is returned. This hash can be used to track the transaction. The next step is to determine the address where our contract is deployed. Each executed transaction will create a receipt. This receipt contains various information about the transaction such as in which block the transaction was included and how much gas was used by the EVM. If a transaction
creates a contract it will also contain the contract address. We can retrieve the receipt with the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` RPC method.

```bash
curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt", "params": ["0xe1f3095770633ab2b18081658bad475439f6a08c902d0915903bafff06e6febf"], "id": 7}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545

```

Our contract was created on `0x4d03d617d700cf81935d7f797f4e2ae719648262`. A null result instead of a receipt means the transaction has
not been included in a block yet. Wait for a moment and check if your miner is running and retry it.

#### Interacting with smart contracts {#interacting-with-smart-contract}

In this example we will be sending a transaction using `eth_sendTransaction` to the `multiply` method of the contract.

`eth_sendTransaction` requires several arguments, specifically `from`, `to` and `data`. `From` is the public address of our account, and `to` is the contract address. The `data` argument contains a payload that defines which method must be called and with which arguments. This is where the [ABI (application binary interface)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html) comes into play. The ABI is a JSON file that defines how to define and encode data for the EVM.

The bytes of the payload defines which method in the contract is called. This is the first 4 bytes from the Keccak hash over the function name and its argument types, hex encoded. The multiply function accepts an uint which is an alias for uint256. This leaves us with:

```javascript
web3.sha3("multiply(uint256)").substring(0, 10)
// "0xc6888fa1"
```

The next step is to encode the arguments. There is only one uint256, say, the value 6. The ABI has a section which specifies how to encode uint256 types.

`int<M>: enc(X)` is the big-endian twoâ€™s complement encoding of X, padded on the higher-order (left) side with 0xff for negative X and with zero > bytes for positive X such that the length is a multiple of 32 bytes.

This encodes to `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006`.

Combining the function selector and the encoded argument our data will be `0xc6888fa10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006`.

This can now be sent to the node:

```bash
curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method": "eth_sendTransaction", "params": [{"from": "0xeb85a5557e5bdc18ee1934a89d8bb402398ee26a", "to": "0x6ff93b4b46b41c0c3c9baee01c255d3b4675963d", "data": "0xc6888fa10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006"}], "id": 8}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545
{"id":8,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x759cf065cbc22e9d779748dc53763854e5376eea07409e590c990eafc0869d74"}
```

Since a transaction was sent, a transaction hash was returned. Retrieving the receipt gives:

```javascript
{
   blockHash: "0xbf0a347307b8c63dd8c1d3d7cbdc0b463e6e7c9bf0a35be40393588242f01d55",
   blockNumber: 268,
   contractAddress: null,
   cumulativeGasUsed: 22631,
   gasUsed: 22631,
   logs: [{
      address: "0x6ff93b4b46b41c0c3c9baee01c255d3b4675963d",
      blockHash: "0xbf0a347307b8c63dd8c1d3d7cbdc0b463e6e7c9bf0a35be40393588242f01d55",
      blockNumber: 268,
      data: "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a",
      logIndex: 0,
      topics: ["0x24abdb5865df5079dcc5ac590ff6f01d5c16edbc5fab4e195d9febd1114503da"],
      transactionHash: "0x759cf065cbc22e9d779748dc53763854e5376eea07409e590c990eafc0869d74",
      transactionIndex: 0
  }],
  transactionHash: "0x759cf065cbc22e9d779748dc53763854e5376eea07409e590c990eafc0869d74",
  transactionIndex: 0
}
```

The receipt contains a log. This log was generated by the EVM on transaction execution and included in the receipt. The `multiply` function shows that the `Print` event was raised with the input times 7. Since the argument for the `Print` event was a uint256 we can decode it according to the ABI rules which will leave us with the expected decimal 42. Apart from the data it is worth noting that topics can be used to determine which event created the log:

```javascript
web3.sha3("Print(uint256)")
// "24abdb5865df5079dcc5ac590ff6f01d5c16edbc5fab4e195d9febd1114503da"
```

This was just a brief introduction into some of the most common tasks, demonstrating direct usage of the JSON-RPC.
