# Active areas of Ethereum research

One of the primary strengths of Ethereum is that an active research and engineering community are constantly improving it. Many enthusiastic, skilled people worldwide would like to apply themselves to outstanding issues in Ethereum, but it is not always easy to find out what those issues are. This page outlines key active research areas as a rough guide to Ethereum's cutting edge.

## How Ethereum research works

Ethereum research is open and transparent. The culture is to make research tools and outputs as open and interactive as possible, for example, through executable notebooks. Ethereum research moves quickly, with new findings posted and discussed in the open on forums such as [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/) rather than reaching the community through traditional publications after rounds of peer review.

## General research resources

Regardless of the specific topic, there is a wealth of information on Ethereum research to be found at [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch) and the [Eth R&D Discord channel](https://discord.gg/n7JxAeRu). These are the primary places where Ethereum researchers discuss the latest ideas and development opportunities.

This report published in May 2022 by [DelphiDigital](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-ethereum) provides a good overview of the Ethereum roadmap.

## Protocol research

Protocol research is concerned with Ethereum's base layer - the set of rules defining how nodes connect, communicate, exchange and store Ethereum data and come to consensus about the state of the blockchain. Protocol research gets divided into two top-level categories: consensus and execution.

### Consensus

Consensus research is concerned with [Ethereum's proof-of-stake mechanism](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/). Some example consensus research topics are:

- identifying and patching vulnerabilities;
- quantifying cryptoeconomic security;
- increasing the security or performance of client implementations;
- and developing light clients.

As well as forward-looking research, some fundamental redesigns of the protocol, such as single slot finality, are being researched to allow for significant improvements to Ethereum. Furthermore, the efficiency, safety, and monitoring of peer-to-peer networking between consensus clients are also important research topics.

- [Proposer-builder separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance)

### Execution

The execution layer is concerned with executing transactions, running the [Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)](/developers/docs/evm/) and generating execution payloads to pass to the consensus layer. There are many active areas of research, especially as execution clients are getting updated in anticipation of [The Merge](/upgrades/merge/). Active areas of research include:

- building out light client support;
- researching gas limits;
- and incorporating new data structures (e.g. Verkle Tries).

## Client Development

Ethereum clients are implementations of the Ethereum protocol. Client development makes the outcomes from protocol research into reality by building them into these clients. Client development includes updating the client specifications as well as building specific implementations.

An Ethereum node is required to run two pieces of software:

1. a consensus client to keep track of the head of the blockchain, gossip blocks and handle consensus logic
2. an execution client to support the Ethereum Virtual Machine and execute transactions.

See the [nodes and clients page](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) for more detail on nodes and clients and for a list of all current client implementations. You can also find a history of all Ethereum upgrades on the [history page](/history/).

## Scaling and performance

Scaling Ethereum is a large area of focus for Ethereum researchers. Current approaches include sharding the blockchain, danksharding, and using rollups. Introductory information on scaling Ethereum is available on our [scaling page](/developers/docs/scaling).

### Layer 2

There are now several Layer 2 protocols that scale Ethereum using different techniques for batching transactions and securing them on Ethereum layer 1. This is a very rapidly growing topic with a lot of research and development potential.

## Security

Security is a broad topic that might include spam/scam prevention, wallet security, hardware security, crypto-economic security, bug hunting and testing of applications and client software and key-management. Contributing to knowledge in these areas will help stimulate mainstream adoption.

### Cryptography & ZKP

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and cryptography are critical for building privacy and security into Ethereum and its applications. Zero-knowledge is a relatively young but fast-moving space with many open research and development opportunities. Some possibilities include developing more efficient implementations of the [Keccak hashing algorithm](https://hackmd.io/sK7v0lr8Txi1bgION1rRpw?view#Overview), finding better polynomial commitments than currently exist or reducing the cost of ecdsa public key generation and signature verification circuits.

- [Ethresear.ch ZK](https://ethresear.ch/c/zk-s-nt-arks/13)

### Wallets

Ethereum wallets can be browser extensions, desktop and mobile apps or smart contracts on Ethereum. There is active research into social recovery wallets that reduce some of the risk associated with individual-user key management. Associated with development of wallets is research into alternative forms of account abstraction, which is an important area of nascent research.

## Community, education and outreach

Onboarding new users onto Ethereum requires new educational resources and approaches to outreach. This might include blog posts and articles, books, podcasts, memes, teaching resources events and anything else that builds communities, welcomes new starters and educates people about Ethereum.

### UX/UI

To onboard more people onto Ethereum, the ecosystem must improve the UX/UI. This will require designers and product experts to re-examine the design of wallets and apps.

- [EIP 1559: One month later](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04753)

### Proof-of-stake incentives

When Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake, validators will use its native asset (ether) as collateral. The cryptoeconomics of this determines the security of the network. Sophisticated validators may be able to exploit the nuances of the incentive layer to their own advantage by extracting MEV or launching explicit attacks.

- [Low-cost attacks on Ethereum 2.0 by sub 1/3 stakeholders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02247)

### Liquid staking and derivatives

Liquid staking allows users with less than 32 ETH to receive staking yields by swapping ether for a token representing staked ether that can be used in DeFi. However, the incentives and market dynamics associated with liquid staking are still being discovered, as well as its effect on Ethereum's security (e.g. centralization risks).

- [Withdrawal credentials](https://ethresear.ch/t/withdrawal-credential-rotation-from-bls-to-eth1/8722)

### Fee markets

Ethereum transaction fees protect the network from spam, denial-of-service attacks and bad smart-contract code. However, it also affects the end-user by influencing the cost of interacting with Ethereum. Balancing network security with end-user experience is an ongoing challenge that requires further research and development.

## Testing

### Formal verification

Formal verification is writing code to verify that Ethereum's consensus specifications are correct and bug-free. There is an executable version of the specification written in Python that requires maintenance and development. Further research can help to improve the Python implementation of the specification and add tools that can more robustly verify correctness and identify issues.

## Apps and tooling

The application layer supports a diverse ecosystem of programs that settle transactions on Ethereum's base layer. Development teams are constantly finding new ways to leverage Ethereum to create composable, permissionless and censorship-resistant versions of important Web2 apps or create completely new Web3-native concepts. At the same time, new tooling is being developed that makes building dapps on Ethereum less complex.

### DeFi

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the primary classes of application built on top of Ethereum. DeFi aims to create composable "money legos" that allow users to store, transfer, lend, borrow and invest crypto-assets using smart contracts. DeFi is a fast-moving space that is constantly updating. Research into secure, efficient and accessible protocols is continuously needed.

### DAOs

An impactful use case for Ethereum is the ability to organize in a decentralized manner through the use of DAOs. There is a lot of active research into how DAOs on Ethereum can be developed and utilized to execute improved forms of governance, as a trust-minimized coordination tool, greatly expanding peoples options beyond traditional corporations and organizations.
